    <h2>GraphKit ( WIP )</h2>
</span>
<p align='center'>Graphing library for SwiftUI</p>
<br />

The eventual goal here is to slowly over time offer similar functionality to D3.js but in a Swift package that can be installed easily via the Swift Package Manager

**If you'd like to follow the development of this project, we have a public feature board [here](https://trello.com/b/1b60nVkE)**
